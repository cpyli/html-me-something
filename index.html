                <h1>Some of My Favorite Places</h1>
                <p>In 2015, I finished school, quit my job, and took off to travel across 20+ countries. Here are some of my favorite places:</p>

                        <h2>Vietnam</h2>
                        <p>One of my favorite countries that I visited in SE Asia is Vietnam. The country is beautiful, the people are friendly, and the food is amazingly delicious. 
                            I flew into Saigon, which is in the south, and worked my way up north to Hanoi. Some highlights in Vietnam include seeing the beautiful caves of Phong Nha,
                            kayaking through the limestone pillars of Ha Long Bay, and trekking through the mountainous rice paddies of Sapa. The food in Vietnam was also some of my favorite, particularly for their uses of fresh herbs.
                            I also tried balut. Interesting is an understatement to describe this street food.

                        <a name="borneo"></a>
                        <h2>Borneo</h2>
                        <p>There are two places that I absolutely loved about Borneo: Bako National Park and Sipadan. Bako National Park has a variety of ecosystems from beaches to different types of forests. 
                            While I don't like monkeys, Bako NP (and Borneo in general) is home to the proboscis monkeys. These are the goofiest (and coolest!) monkeys I've ever encounted. Added bonus is that the proboscis monkeys mind their own business. 
                            Sipadan is an itty bitty tiny island off the coast of Borneo. The #1 reason to go is to dive. I saw all sorts of cool creatures while diving: tiny seahorses, big sea turtles, and giant devil rays. 
                            No words can do Borneo justice and I can't wait to return some day!

                        <h2>Italy</h2>
                        <p>After visiting SE Asia, I also traveled through Europe. This was a great contrast to SE Asia and made me appreciate what both places had to offer much more. 
                            Italy was one of my favorite countries that I visited in Europe for two reasons: art and food. Seeing the transformation of art over the centuries is needless to say, amazing. 
                            I particularly liked gothic art for its "flat" use of colors and the elaborate architecture of the old buildings, especially when there were domes. 
                            Italy also had some of the best food in Europe. Picking fresh foods from the grocery to have as a picnic along the waterfront in Venice was one of my favorite moments. </p>
